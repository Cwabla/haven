# README

Simple blog application built with Ruby on Rails, some motivating philosophies:

* Privacy-first.  This is for sharing with friends and family, not commercial endevors.  If you want a blog for your company, you probably want to use Wordpress instead
* Easy to use.
* Low-bandwidth friendly.  Images get downscaled to reduce page load times.  No javascript.
* Customizable.  If you want to add custom CSS, you can do that
* No spam. There is no self-signup for users so there is no place for unauthorized users to impact your life
