# Next Steps

## Bugs
 * During upload of an image, the text field is still available for editing

## Deployment
 * script to update deployed blog to latest/specific version
   * including update of version blob
 * load a backup if present on deployment
 * Figure out why it doesn't work with t3.nano
 * Experiment with initialized AMI

## App
 * Try dual local storage + S3, see if content laods faster
 * Change images to -img- tags, with width and height for placeholders
 * Model validations!!
 * Markdown helptext
 * basic_auth check for images to support RSS
 * Export functionality
 * Delete user flow for deleting authors with live posts

## Reader
 * https://selfoss.aditu.de/ - FOSS, self-hosted
   * Try it out, add deployment

# Tech Debt
 * upload image link throws error if no file selected
 * import fails unless directories have trailing slash ("/")
 * failed import doesn't display an error
 * successful import doesn't display success on completion
 * Move user creation logic into model and reuse it between controller and create_user script
 * Post form has two buttons, and I have logic based on their value.  Move the value of the special button to a variable/constant so I can't break the logic by renaming the text
 * Add validation to post form
 * Add validation to settings form
