# Next Steps

## Deployment
 * Move configs out of ENV vars and into a templated config file 
     https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv
 * Figure out why it doesn't work with t3.nano
 * Experiment with initialized AMI

## App
 * RSS token/url generation
 * Markdown helptext
 * Delete user flow for deleting authors with live posts
 * Better CSS
   * Fix selectors for radio and checkbox
   * Larger font so only 75~90 chars/line?
   * Author byline needs different styling
   * Consistent units: rem/px
   * @media query for darkmode?
 * Configure mail - nevermind, this is hard.

# Tech Debt

Add validation to post form

Add validation to settings form
