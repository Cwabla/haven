# Next Steps

* S3 image storage
* S3 DB backups

## Deployment
 * load a backup if present on deployment
 * Figure out why it doesn't work with t3.nano
 * Experiment with initialized AMI
 * Script to upgrade code on a deployment
 * Move user creation logic into model and reuse it between controller and create_user script

## App
 * Automated Backups to S3
 * RRS link to user-specific RSS url
 * Model validations!!
 * Markdown helptext
 * basic_auth check for images to support RSS
 * Export functionality
 * Delete user flow for deleting authors with live posts
 * Better CSS
   * Fix selectors for radio and checkbox
   * Larger font so only 75~90 chars/line?
   * Author byline needs different styling
   * Consistent units: rem/px
   * @media query for darkmode?
 * Configure mail - nevermind, this is hard.

# Tech Debt
 * import fails unless directories have trailing slash ("/")
 * failed import doesn't display an error
 * successful import doesn't display success on completion
 * Post form has two buttons, and I have logic based on their value.  Move the value of the special button to a variable/constant so I can't break the logic by renaming the text
 * Add validation to post form
 * Add validation to settings form
