# Next Steps

## Deployment
 * Figure out why it doesn't work with t3.nano
 * Make sure certbot is set to auto renew certs

## App
 * RSS token/url generation
 * Markdown helptext
 * Better CSS
   * Larger font so only 75~80 chars/line
   * Consistent units: rem/px
   * @media query for darkmode
 * Configure mail - nevermind, this is hard.

Add validation to post form

Add validation to settings form
