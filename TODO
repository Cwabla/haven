# Tech Debt

Post form has two buttons, and I have logic based on their value.  Move the value of the special button to a variable/constant so I can't break the logic by renaming the text

Add validation to post form

Add validation to settings form

Settings radio button uses text which logic on it, set those values to variables/constants
